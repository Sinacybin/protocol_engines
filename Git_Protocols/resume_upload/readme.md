# Mirror OS Systems — Universal Protocol Engines Directory

**Author:** Simon Martin, Founder & Systems Architect  
**Platform:** Mirror OS Systems  
**Version:** v1.0 (Canonical Directory Readme)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-14

## Overview

This directory (`01_protocol_engines/`) contains the **canonical suite of Mirror OS Protocol Engines**. Each subdirectory implements a meta-template driven, audit-ready system for automating and standardizing high-leverage organizational workflows. These engines embody the recursive, compliance-enforced, and meta-architected approach foundational to Mirror OS Systems.

> **All protocol engines inherit a unified audit, privacy, and compliance meta-architecture.  
> Each system is modular, upgradable, and recursively verifiable.**

**If referencing or sharing, credit Mirror OS Systems and Simon Martin as the originating architect.**

## System Architecture

All protocol engines follow these meta-structural rules:

- **Recursive Meta-Layering:**  
    Every protocol is governed by a multi-level meta-template (Meta-1 through Meta-6), ensuring transparent audit, leverage field flagging, and compliance overlay in every output.
    
- **Audit-Ready by Default:**  
    Each protocol instance includes audit blocks, compliance logic, version control, and micro-ritual/brand layers—codified in both YAML and human-readable documentation.
    
- **No Clinical, Production, or Legal Use:**  
    All artifacts here are demo or reference only. For licensing, production deployment, or legal/clinical consultation, contact Simon Martin directly.

## Canonical Use Cases

- **Supplementation Protocols:**  
    Instant, evidence-based supplement stacks for coaches, with audit and compliance layers.
    
- **Onboarding Protocols:**  
    Automated, defensible employee onboarding for HR/ops, including audit, compliance, and asset tracking.
    
- **Sales Playbooks:**  
    Audit-aligned, versioned sales pipelines, with built-in compliance and objection handling.
    
- **Compliance Policies:**  
    End-to-end GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) protocol generation, escalation, and audit tracking.
    
- **Content Production:**  
    Multichannel, compliance-ready content creation and release workflow, including asset and revision audit.
    
- **Philosophical Deconstruction:**  
    Multi-layered audit and synthesis of philosophical claims and models, for advanced epistemic/organizational insight.

## Meta-Principles

- **Unified Compliance Core:**  
    All engines are recursively auditable, flag drift/failure, and enforce version traceability.
    
- **Modular Expansion:**  
    Each protocol is independently upgradable and designed for rapid adaptation to new business, compliance, or creative domains.
    
- **Privacy & Data Security:**  
    No sensitive or production data is included. All protocol data is processed under [Mirror OS Systems Privacy Policy](https://mirroros.systems/privacy).

## Legal & Licensing

> **Demo Only. Not for production, clinical, or live consulting use.  
> Extraction, reverse engineering, or unlicensed distribution is strictly prohibited.**
